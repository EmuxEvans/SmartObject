ObjectService Base Classes

ObjectService is a SmartObject instance which is used to store a 
Description for the service and a number of SmartObject instances

GatewayObjectService is an ObjectService with two service interfaces, for example 
one interface for a constrained network e.g. a sensor net using CoAP, and 
another interface for the internet using http.

The interface classes add URL-resource mapping, and content-type negotiation 
and generation by invoking parse and serialize methods from the specific 
resource classes.

SmartObjectService is a service that is created from a Python application 
in order to embed SmartObject resources and service endpoints into the 
application and make the application node a deployable component of a larger
application graph. 

Weather Sensor files are a demonstration of the SmartObject API used on both 
an ARM PC gateway (Raspberry Pi, etc) and a cloud service to provide an API 
to data produced by an Arduino-based, http client capable sensor endpoint.
